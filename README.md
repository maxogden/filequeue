# FileQueue [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pezra/filequeue.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pezra/filequeue)

A simple file based queue written in Ruby that uses the battle-tested [`Filelock`](https://github.com/sheerun/filelock) gem to push and pop items into a queue. It's not web scale but is nice for lightweight async queuing apps.

## Install

```ruby
gem install filequeue
```

## Usage

```ruby
queue = FileQueue.new 'queue_party.txt'

queue.push "an item"
# => true

queue.pop
# => "an item"
```

See `spec/filequeue_spec.rb` for more usage details

## Docs

`FileQueue` has the following class methods:

* `push` (alias `<<`)
* `pop`
* `length`
* `empty?`
* `clear`

## Dependencies

Locking is delegated to the excellent [`Filelock`](https://github.com/sheerun/filelock) gem.
All of the `Filelock`'s [caveats](https://github.com/sheerun/filelock#faq) apply.

## Limitations

* NFS is [not supported](https://github.com/sheerun/filelock#faq)
